# Why is food so expensive nowadays?
A data visualization project exploring the potential causes behind the high prices of food today. Mainly uses React and D3.js.

To run the project, install the packages with `npm init` then run `npm start`.

## Data Sources
My spreadsheet containing my sources and original .csv files can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Qcm4pZ3EbAPCV3ndg5vRBFeu_duk7GwUoJ_WrWvjAo/edit?usp=sharing). Some of the data may differ from what is in the repo (different column names, removed unnecessary data, etc.).

## Development Workflow
- Research and collect data
- Look at examples of D3.js charts and how their data was formatted
  - If necessary, format data to mimic their organization and structure
- Take chart code and turn it into a React component
- Modify code to be re-usable (work with different .csv files, as long as they follow the same structure)
- Add extra features (tool tips, chart transitions via. buttons, etc.)
- Add story and stylize text elements with some CSS

## What I learned
- The basics of React (how to use `UseState`, define and pass in props, etc.)
  - It's advantages over HTML â€” For example, with my transition button components, instead of making each button individually, React and JS can take my data and make a button for each one
- How to work with D3.js
  - Parsing .csv files and their data
  - Modifying charts to add transitions
  - Modifying charts to be React components
  - Adding tooltips and using mouse events
    - Adding classes to the SVG elements created and interacting with them

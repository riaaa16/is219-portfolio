# Understanding RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by providing them with additional context retrieved from external sources before generating a response.

## Key Components of RAG

1. **Document Ingestion**: Converting various document formats into processable text.
2. **Chunking**: Breaking down documents into smaller, manageable pieces.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Converting text chunks into vector representations.
4. **Vector Storage**: Storing embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search.
5. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information based on query similarity.
6. **Context Augmentation**: Enhancing the prompt with retrieved information.
7. **Response Generation**: Creating a final response using the augmented context.

## Benefits of RAG

- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual information
- Enables access to domain-specific knowledge
- Updates model knowledge without retraining
- Improves transparency through citation of sources
- Enhances privacy by keeping sensitive data in controlled environments

# Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search vector embeddings efficiently. They are a critical component in modern AI applications that leverage semantic search and similarity matching.

## What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in a high-dimensional space. For text:

- Words or chunks of text are converted into vectors of floating-point numbers
- Similar concepts end up close to each other in the vector space
- This enables semantic search beyond simple keyword matching

## Vector Database Operations

1. **Indexing**: Creating efficient data structures for storing vectors
2. **Similarity Search**: Finding vectors close to a query vector using distance metrics like:
   - Euclidean distance
   - Cosine similarity
   - Dot product
3. **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)**: Algorithms that trade perfect accuracy for speed
4. **Filtering**: Combining vector search with metadata filtering
